# Codeglyph

[Visit the website !](http://codeglyph.eu/)

**Codeglyph** is a full-stack web application that automatically collects, processes, and displays articles and repositories relevant to developers using Celery and JWT authentication. It combines a Python Django REST backend with a modern JavaScript frontend built using Vite and React.

---

## 🚀 Distinctiveness and Complexity

### Why this project is distinctive and complex:

- **Business Logic-Driven Article Generation**: Articles are automatically generated by utility functions (`utils.py`) based on predefined logic and scheduling rules, making the content dynamically updated.
- **Asynchronous Task Scheduling**: The backend integrates **Celery** with a periodic task scheduler (via `celerybeat`) to fetch and update articles in the background, making it robust and scalable.
- **JWT-Based Authentication**: The authentication system is implemented using **JSON Web Tokens**, providing secure and stateless login sessions.
- **API-First Architecture**: The backend is designed as a RESTful API using Django REST Framework (DRF), which serves the frontend and could support future mobile or third-party clients.
- **State Management with React Context API**: The frontend manages authentication state and saved articles using React's built-in Context API, avoiding unnecessary dependencies.
- **Full Docker Support**: The application is fully containerized using Docker and orchestrated with `docker-compose`, making it easy to deploy in development or production.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Application

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devpulse.git
cd devpulse
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `devpulse_backend/` and define at least the following:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your-django-secret
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_reddit_secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your reddit agent


```

(Optional) Set environment variables for Celery and frontend as needed.

### 3. Build and Run with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
- The backend API will be at `http://localhost:8000/api`

### 4. Run Migrations (first time only)

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. (Optional) Create a Superuser

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## 📝 Additional Notes

- The article feed updates automatically in the background, even if no user is logged in.
- Saved articles are tied to user accounts, and data is managed via Django's ORM.
- The frontend is fully decoupled and can be replaced by any client that can consume a REST API.
- The project is structured for easy extensibility, whether adding new data sources or deploying to a cloud platform.
